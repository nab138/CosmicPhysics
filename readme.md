# Cosmic Physics

Real physics in CR! Buggy, but not too bad.

## Usage: 
- Infuser: Right click to turn blocks into physics objects or vise versa
- Gravity gun: Right click to pick up blocks, right click again to drop (or punch to launch)
- Linker: Right click two blocks to link them together
- Dropped items are physics objects by default

## Recipes
